# PythonFlaskApp
I have created simple python-flask application which performs CRUD operations with mysql database. Basically flask is the python light weight backend api.

# How The Application Is Implemented ....?
I had done some sort of sequential tasks to build this crud application in python-flask with web-interface to interact with my backend server.
* First I had created some sort of front-end templates which are actually responsible to interact with python-flask in backend.

* After that I had created <b>All_In_One.py</b> named python file which is having all the code for doing operations related to the python-flask server hence backend and response back to the front-end part hence you can easily visualize it. As all know <b>"<i>Seeing is always better than Reading.</i>"</b> Hence front-end is always required to be well drafted with advanced CSS(3) features and bootstrap.You can refer bootstrap file from it's official page link is <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/">here</a>. You need to download bootstrap file or you can directly refer to the CDN Links available on the site.

* Now you are supposed to run python file from command line which is <b>"python \__filename__.py"</b>

* If you don't have mysql installed then first configure it and then create neccessary tables and then again run this application.

* Hence run the <b>" All_In_One.py "</b> file and now your server will listen on some specific port. And you see application works.
